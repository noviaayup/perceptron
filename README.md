Perceptron - ML Model using iris dataset

**Perceptron Data Algorithms**

In this code below, we'll introduce the Single-Layer Perceptron (aka "Neuron" or simply "Perceptron"), the most fundamental element of nearly all modern neural network and machine learning models.  We'll begin by loading the data, then visualise and actually implement the element from scratch.
